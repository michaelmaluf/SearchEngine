# SearchEngine
Search Engine built with python and flask. The search engine utilizes a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) approach enhance the search algorithm and display the most relevant results based on user input.

I have plans on building a Twitter clone with a front-end and back-end that utilizes this search engine. The search engine would sift through the usernames and tweets located in the db and display results based on relevancy to the user. 

Concepts excelled/learned:
1. Basic of integrating unit testing into my program. 
2. How to build and utilize a TF-IDF algorithm.
3. Integrating javascript for the front-end and python w/flask for the backend.
